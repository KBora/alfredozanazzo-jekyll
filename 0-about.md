Alfredo Zanazzo, born in Imperia, a small town in the north-western italian coast between Genova and Nice, began a musical career in the mid seventies as pianist-singer of commercial music. Heard by chance while playing in a middle-east club by an Italian baritone, he was advised to change his inclination toward opera singing.


After auditions in Italy, he decided to start training in classical opera and was discovered to possess a true and rich bass voice.

The great bass Tancredi Pasero was interested in him and provided artistic and technical help to the young singer, who continued later his musical education with the bass Bonaldo Giaiotti  and Maestro Renato Pastorino of La Scala in Milan.

After winning several international contests, he made his succesful debut in Arena Di Verona in 1981 as the King in Verdi's Aida. By the end of the same year he was singing Zaccaria in Nabucco at the opening of Trieste's opera season, and shortly after he appeared for the first time in La Scala, Milan, with the important role of Narbal in the opera Les Troyens of Berlioz, conducted by Georges Pretre.

During the following years he sung in almost all the major opera houses in the world, like the Staatsopra in Vienna, Salle Garnier in Paris, The Metropolitan in New York and the opera houses of Munich, Geneva, Zurich, Hamburg, San Diego, Las Palmas, Toronto, Torino and all the other big Italian theatres.

Alfredo Zanazzo is reknown for his genuine dark and powerful timbre, suitable for dramatic Verdi roles as well as for *bel canto*, due to the warm and noble quality of his voice
